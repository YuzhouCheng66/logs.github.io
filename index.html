      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Visual localization plays a crucial role in mobile robotics and augmented reality. Recent advances such as Gaussian Splatting have enabled realistic novel view synthesis, providing a promising foundation for localization tasks. However, existing methods typically require hundreds of training images to achieve good results. In this paper, we present LoGS, a system that tackles the few-shot localization problem by modifying Gaussian Splatting to allow training with very limited images. Our experime...

      <h2>Method Overview</h2>
      <p>
        LoGS introduces an efficient pipeline for few-shot localization leveraging Gaussian Splatting. The system consists of two stages: map construction with limited training images, and robust online localization based on differentiable rendering and optimization. Details can be found in our paper.
